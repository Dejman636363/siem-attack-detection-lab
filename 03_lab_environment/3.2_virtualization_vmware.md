## Virtualized Environment (VMware Workstation)

All machines were launched in **VMware Workstation**, which provides high configuration flexibility and allows the creation of custom **virtual networks (vmnet)**.  
This technology made it possible to build a fully **isolated and controlled test environment**.

Virtualization enables quick restoration of machine states, cloning, and testing various attack scenarios.  
This brings significant value in terms of **research repeatability** and the potential for **further development of the environment**.

Each subnet was assigned to a different **pfSense** interface:

- `em0` – WAN interface, bridged to the home router (DHCP)
- `em1` – detection network interface (`192.168.6.1`)
- `em2` – attacking network interface (`192.168.2.1`)
- `em3` – victim network interface (`192.168.3.1`)
- `em4` – monitoring interface (**SPAN/mirror** from `em3`)

This setup allows full **control and analysis of network traffic** according to the **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** architecture model.
