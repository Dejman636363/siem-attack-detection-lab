## Laboratory Environment

The laboratory environment was designed to emulate a real corporate infrastructure, incorporating **network segmentation**, a **firewall**, an **internet access gateway**, **victim machines**, an **attacking machine**, and **detection components**.  

A key element is the division into **logical VLAN subnets**, which enables precise traffic control and environmental isolation.

As outlined in **Chapter 2.1**, effective **network monitoring** and **segmentation** are fundamental elements of organizational security.  
This architecture makes it possible to analyze activity across different layers â€” from **network traffic** to **local user actions**.
