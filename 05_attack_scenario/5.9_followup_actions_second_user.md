## 5.9 Follow-Up Actions After Logging in as Another User

After **restarting the machine** and logging in as a different user (`Damian`),  
**two independent Apollo agent callbacks were automatically launched**:

- one running with **SYSTEM privileges**, activated by the **scheduled task**
- the other running with **regular user privileges**, activated by the **registry entry**

(**Figure 12**)

Within the new `Damian` user session, operations similar to the previous stage were performed:

- confirmed the **privileges of both agents** using `whoami`
- captured a **screenshot** via the Apollo agent running with **regular user privileges**
- injected a **keylogger** into the `notepad.exe` process (PID `22456`) using the Apollo agent running with **SYSTEM privileges** this action was performed on the file `DaneDoKeyloggeraDAMIAN.txt` located on the `Damian` user’s desktop.
