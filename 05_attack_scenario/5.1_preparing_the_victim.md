## 5.1 Preparing the Victim Environment

To simulate a **configuration mistake commonly made by administrators**, deliberate security weaknesses were introduced on the victim workstation (`192.168.3.10`).

Custom **Windows Defender Firewall** rules were created using **PowerShell** to allow **incoming traffic to port 3389 (RDP)** from **any source**:

```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Zła reguła RDP"
-Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 3389
-Action Allow
```

Additionally, the **“Password must meet complexity requirements”** policy was **disabled** in the **domain GPO settings**.

For experimental purposes, **port 22 (SSH)** was also opened, although it was **not used during the attack scenario**.

This configuration was intended to simulate **additional potential attack vectors** that might remain **exposed due to system misconfiguration**.
