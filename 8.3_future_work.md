## 8.3. Proposals for Expanding the Environment and Future Research

The possibilities for further development of the created laboratory environment are **virtually unlimited**, and the direction of growth can be **adapted to specific needs**.  
The current infrastructure provides a **solid foundation for further experiments, tests, and research** â€” both in the context of **new detection techniques, incident response components, and penetration testing capabilities**.

One of the key development directions is the **implementation of SOAR-class components** such as **TheHive** and **Cortex**, integrated with the **Elastic Stack**.  
This would enable **realistic simulation of incident response (IR) procedures**, including:

- case management,  
- assigning tasks to analysts,  
- documenting actions,  
- and building automated operational playbooks.

By integrating with the **MISP threat intelligence platform**, it would also be possible to **automatically generate alerts from collected IoCs**, and **handle incidents correlated from multiple data sources**.

Another valuable addition would be deploying a **Cowrie honeypot** exposed to the external network.  
This would allow **observing attack attempts, scanning activity, brute-force attacks**, and **analyzing the behavior of bots and real threat actors**.

It would also be beneficial to **add machines running vulnerable operating systems** (e.g., older versions of Windows or Linux) to enable:

- realistic **penetration testing of known exploits**,  
- and **analyzing their traces in logs**.

Additional attack scenarios could include:

- **lateral movement techniques**,  
- **attacks on IIS servers**,  
- **attacks on Active Directory infrastructure**,  
- and **testing various techniques from the MITRE ATT&CK model**.

These could then be followed by **detection exercises**.  
Because the **VMware virtualization platform** supports **snapshots**, penetration tests could be much more destructive **without risking damage to the entire infrastructure**.

Another area worth exploring is **redesigning the environment to include a DMZ zone**, which would make it **more similar to a real organizational network architecture**.

It would also be valuable to:

- **test Suricata in IPS mode**, placing it **inline on the pfSense firewall**, allowing **real-time blocking of malicious traffic**  
- **enable real-time protection in Elastic Defend (EDR)**  
- **create and test custom detection rules in Sigma**, based on past attacks and detections  
  - convert created triggers into Sigma format  
  - or download public Sigma rules, adapt them to the environment, and test their effectiveness

Other possible extensions include:

- Testing and tuning **firewalls**  
- Extending logging to include **memory forensics** using tools like **Volatility**  
- Using the already implemented **Wazuh platform** to gain **more advanced HIDS rules, file integrity monitoring, and anomaly alerting** compared to the base Elastic Stack  
- Testing additional offensive tools from **Kali Linux** (e.g., **Metasploit**)  
- Using tools such as **Velociraptor** to **collect and analyze forensic artifacts from endpoints**

Finally, a natural continuation of this work would be **developing new attack scenarios based on real APT campaigns**, analyzing their progression within the lab, and **testing the effectiveness of detection using custom correlation rules and alerts**.  
Such activities would further improve understanding of **how SIEM components react** and how to **build effective detection and incident response systems**.
