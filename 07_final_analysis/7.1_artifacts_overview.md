## 7.1. Overview of Collected Artifacts and Their Significance

As a result of the executed attack scenario and the analysis of data recorded by the detection systems, a number of **artifacts were identified that play a crucial role in the threat detection process**.  
These artifacts are **direct traces of the attacker’s activity** in the system or network and can be used **both for real-time detection and post-incident forensic analysis**.

The most important collected artifacts include:

- **IP addresses** – especially the **attacker’s machine IP (192.168.2.10)**, which appears in many logs related to **network traffic, login attempts, RDP sessions, and C2 connections**  
- **Malicious file hash (SHA-256, MD5)** – allows **identifying the specific malware sample in external sources such as VirusTotal**. In this case, the recorded **SHA-256 hash** was: `532dcc580c1c75125d938215ee15b435a5e2746fbb8df6a26318b1a43f30eab1`
- **File names and paths** –  `C:\Users\Public\Downloads\update_service_Mal.exe` indicates the **location from which the Apollo agent was downloaded and executed**
- **OriginalFileName metadata** – reveals the **original internal name (`Apollo.exe`)** of the executable, helping **detect attempts to masquerade as legitimate applications**
- **PowerShell commands (including Base64-encoded)** – such as `-EncodedCommand`, `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Start-Process`, or `Add-MpPreference`, which can indicate **downloading files, creating malicious processes, or manipulating Defender settings**
- **Logon events (Event ID 4624, 4625, 4672, 4634)** – show **how access to the system was gained, the duration of sessions, and logon types (e.g. LogonType 3 and 10)**, allowing **precise tracking of user actions**
- **PowerShell and cmd child processes** – useful for **reconstructing the attacker’s activity path**, especially when they include **reconnaissance (`ipconfig`, `whoami`, `systeminfo`)** or **persistence creation (`schtasks`, `regedit`)**
- **Windows registry changes** (`HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`) – indicate **attempts to run malicious software at system startup**. In this case, **used to run the Apollo agent with standard user privileges**
- **Task Scheduler entries** – artifacts of **process execution with SYSTEM privileges**, which may indicate **privilege escalation and persistence**
- **Process injections** – although most actions by the Apollo agent did not create visible processes, **an injection into a Notepad process was recorded**
- **Zeek and Suricata alerts** – showing **network anomalies, scanning, brute-force activity, and HTTP-based communication**

Each of these artifacts provides **unique insights into the attack**.  
When combined, they create a **complete picture of the incident**, allowing analysts to:

- **confirm that the attack occurred**
- **reconstruct its timeline and progression**
- **evaluate the effectiveness of the techniques used**
- **formulate recommendations to improve security**
